# Bootstrap Task: Fill Project Development Guidelines

**You (the AI) are running this task. The developer does not read this file.**

The developer just initialized Moluoxixi for this project. Prepare
`.moluoxixi/spec-proposals/` candidates for the team's real coding conventions.
Do not directly replace formal specs; a human reviews and promotes candidates first.

## Status

- [ ] Fill frontend guidelines
- [ ] Add real code examples

## Spec files to populate

Backend projects should document directory structure, database access, error
handling, logging, review standards, and testing. Frontend projects should
document component organization, component and hook patterns, state ownership,
type safety, linting, testing, and accessibility. For a monorepo, do this under
each approved package scope. The pre-filled thinking guides should change only
when they clearly do not fit this repository.

## Process

1. Import existing convention files first: AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules,
   Copilot instructions, CONTRIBUTING.md, .editorconfig, and equivalent docs.
2. Scan real code for anything not covered. Find 2-3 real examples for every
   documented pattern and reference their paths.
3. Document current reality, including known debt; do not write aspirational rules.
4. Use `moluoxixi-spec-bootstrap` to prepare complete candidates and submit one proposal per target.
5. Present the proposal batch and use `moluoxixi-spec-review` only after explicit human approval.

## Runtime mechanics

- Every task carries implement.jsonl and check.jsonl context manifests.
- Project hooks inject those spec files plus the task PRD into implementation and
  verification prompts.
- The reviewed project spec directory is the convention source of truth; empty specs lead
  to generic output, while examples from real code reproduce team patterns.

When the proposal batch contains real examples and the human has reviewed the decisions, finish and archive this task:

```bash
python ./.moluoxixi/scripts/task.py finish
python ./.moluoxixi/scripts/task.py archive 00-bootstrap-guidelines
```

Future developers receive a `00-join-<slug>` onboarding task.

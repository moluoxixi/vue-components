# Update Code-Spec - Capture Executable Contracts

When you learn something valuable, prepare a complete candidate for the relevant code-spec and submit it to `.moluoxixi/spec-proposals/`. Do not directly edit `.moluoxixi/spec/`; only `spec-review` may promote approved knowledge.

**Timing**: After completing a task, fixing a bug, or discovering a new pattern

---

## Code-Spec First Rule (CRITICAL)

In this project, "spec" for implementation work means **code-spec**:
- Executable contracts (not principle-only text)
- Concrete signatures, payload fields, env keys, and boundary behavior
- Testable validation/error behavior

If the change touches infra or cross-layer contracts, code-spec depth is mandatory.

### Mandatory Triggers

Apply code-spec depth when the change includes any of:
- New/changed command or API signature
- Cross-layer request/response contract change
- Database schema/migration change
- Infra integration (storage, queue, cache, secrets, env wiring)

### Mandatory Output (7 Sections)

For triggered tasks, include all sections below:
1. Scope / Trigger
2. Signatures (command/API/DB)
3. Contracts (request/response/env)
4. Validation & Error Matrix
5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
6. Tests Required (with assertion points)
7. Wrong vs Correct (at least one pair)

## When to Update Code-Specs

| Trigger | Example | Target Spec |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Implemented a feature** | Added a new integration or module | Relevant spec file |
| **Made a design decision** | Chose extensibility pattern over simplicity | Relevant spec + "Design Decisions" section |
| **Fixed a bug** | Found a subtle issue with error handling | Relevant spec (e.g., error-handling docs) |
| **Discovered a pattern** | Found a better way to structure code | Relevant spec file |
| **Hit a gotcha** | Learned that X must be done before Y | Relevant spec + "Common Mistakes" section |
| **Established a convention** | Team agreed on naming pattern | Quality guidelines |
| **New thinking trigger** | "Don't forget to check X before doing Y" | `guides/*.md` (as a checklist item) |

**Key Insight**: Code-spec updates are NOT just for problems. Every feature implementation contains design decisions and contracts that future AI/developers need to execute safely.

## Spec Structure Overview

```
.moluoxixi/spec/
├── <layer>/           # Per-layer coding standards (e.g., backend/, frontend/, api/)
│   ├── index.md       # Overview and links
│   └── *.md           # Topic-specific guidelines
└── guides/            # Thinking checklists (NOT coding specs!)
    ├── index.md       # Guide index
    └── *.md           # Topic-specific guides
```

### CRITICAL: Code-Spec vs Guide - Know the Difference

| Type | Location | Purpose | Content Style |
|------|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Code-Spec** | `<layer>/*.md` | Tell AI "how to implement safely" | Signatures, contracts, matrices, cases, test points |
| **Guide** | `guides/*.md` | Help AI "what to think about" | Checklists, questions, pointers to specs |

**Decision Rule**: Ask yourself:

- "This is **how to write** the code" → Put in a spec layer directory
- "This is **what to consider** before writing" → Put in `guides/`

**Example**:

| Learning | Wrong Location | Correct Location |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "Use API X not API Y for this task" | ❌ `guides/` (too specific for a thinking guide) | ✅ Relevant spec file (concrete convention) |
| "Remember to check X when doing Y" | ❌ Spec file (too abstract for a spec) | ✅ `guides/` (thinking checklist) |

**Guides should be short checklists that point to specs**, not duplicate the detailed rules.

## Update Process

### Step 1: Identify What You Learned

Answer these questions:

1. **What did you learn?** (Be specific)
2. **Why is it important?** (What problem does it prevent?)
3. **Where does it belong?** (Which spec file?)

### Step 2: Classify the Update Type

| Type | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Design Decision** | Why we chose approach X over Y | Add to "Design Decisions" section |
| **Project Convention** | How we do X in this project | Add to relevant section with examples |
| **New Pattern** | A reusable approach discovered | Add to "Patterns" section |
| **Forbidden Pattern** | Something that causes problems | Add to "Anti-patterns" or "Don't" section |
| **Common Mistake** | Easy-to-make error | Add to "Common Mistakes" section |
| **Convention** | Agreed-upon standard | Add to relevant section |
| **Gotcha** | Non-obvious behavior | Add warning callout |

### Step 3: Read the Target Code-Spec

Before editing, read the current code-spec to:
- Understand existing structure
- Avoid duplicating content
- Find the right section for your update

```bash
cat .moluoxixi/spec/<category>/<file>.md
```

### Step 4: Prepare the Proposed Result

Follow these principles:

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete examples, not just abstract rules
2. **Explain Why**: State the problem this prevents
3. **Show Contracts**: Add signatures, payload fields, and error behavior
4. **Show Code**: Add code snippets for key patterns
5. **Keep it Short**: One concept per section

Write the complete desired target content to a task-local candidate file, normally under the active task's `research/` directory. The candidate must include the existing content that should remain; proposals are complete desired states, not ambiguous patches.

Submit it without modifying the formal spec:

```bash
node ./.moluoxixi/scripts/spec-proposals.mjs propose \
  --target <category/file.md> \
  --content-file <task-local-candidate.md> \
  --source-task <active-task-path> \
  --reason "<why this knowledge should be retained>"
```

For obsolete knowledge that should be removed, use `--delete` instead of `--content-file`.

### Step 5: Propose Index Changes Separately (if needed)

If the category index must change, create a separate proposal for its complete reviewed result. Do not assume approval of one target approves another target.

## Interactive Mode

If you're unsure what to update, answer these prompts:

1. **What did you just finish?**
   - [ ] Fixed a bug
   - [ ] Implemented a feature
   - [ ] Refactored code
   - [ ] Had a discussion about approach

2. **What did you learn or decide?**
   - Design decision (why X over Y)
   - Project convention (how we do X)
   - Non-obvious behavior (gotcha)
   - Better approach (pattern)

3. **Would future AI/developers need to know this?**
   - To understand how the code works → Yes, update spec
   - To maintain or extend the feature → Yes, update spec
   - To avoid repeating mistakes → Yes, update spec
   - Purely one-off implementation detail → Maybe skip

4. **Which area does it relate to?**
   - [ ] Backend code
   - [ ] Frontend code
   - [ ] Cross-layer data flow
   - [ ] Code organization/reuse
   - [ ] Quality/testing

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finishing your knowledge proposal:

- [ ] Is the content specific and actionable?
- [ ] Did you include a code example?
- [ ] Did you explain WHY, not just WHAT?
- [ ] Did you include executable signatures/contracts?
- [ ] Did you include validation and error matrix?
- [ ] Did you include Good/Base/Bad cases?
- [ ] Did you include required tests with assertion points?
- [ ] Is it in the right code-spec file?
- [ ] Does it duplicate existing content?
- [ ] Would a new team member understand it?
- [ ] Was it submitted to `spec-proposals` without directly editing `spec/`?
- [ ] Did you leave approval and promotion to `spec-review` and the user?

## Relationship to Other Commands

```
Development Flow:
  Learn something → `update-spec` → pending proposal → human `spec-review`
       ↑                                                       ↓
  `break-loop` ←──────────────────────── approved `.moluoxixi/spec/`
  (deep bug analysis)
```

- ``break-loop` (Moluoxixi command)` - Analyzes bugs deeply, often reveals spec updates needed
- ``update-spec` (Moluoxixi command)` - Creates reviewable knowledge proposals
- ``spec-review` (Moluoxixi command)` - Reviews and promotes approved proposals
- ``finish-work` (Moluoxixi command)` - Reminds you to check if specs need updates

---

## Core Philosophy

> **Code-specs are living documents. Every debugging session, every "aha moment" is an opportunity to make the implementation contract clearer.**

The goal is **institutional memory**:
- What one person learns, everyone benefits from
- What AI learns in one session, persists to future sessions
- Mistakes become documented guardrails
